<a href = "allocation.php"><button type = "button" id = "agreeButton"/>I Agree</button></a> <!--------allocation.php is the file that'll contain the allocation process, feel free to change all the names if you want to. These are just the names I made. But as soon the person clicks it's supposed to search all the Database called Rooms, table by table, the table is vacant if the number of occupants is less than 4. If there are no more rooms in a certain building then let it switch to the next building.-------->
